## Usage
The app works on localhost, but I cannot get it to deploy to heroku for some reason, so it is what it is at this point. The deployed application is supposed to be found at https://shielded-journey-73080.herokuapp.com/. Instead, to see the app in action, please download the files located in this repository; install dependencies as found in the package.json files; and run `npm install`, `npm run seed`, and `npm start`.
